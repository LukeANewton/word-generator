# Word gennerator for Scrabble, Words with Friends, etc.
A jupyter notebook that generates valid English words from an input character sequence.

The script takes an input character sequence (which can include wildcards) and generates the possible combinations of characters. This set of combinations is filtered using [pyenchant](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/) to obtain the valid words.

This small project is born from the boredom of COVID-19 (one of many, I'm sure)
